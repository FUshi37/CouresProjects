1. yes, a feasible solution is [1 2 1] which is bbbabbbbb
2. no, we can only choose 1 as the first one, [a] and [aa], then we must follow at least a "a" after [a], so we can choose 1 or 2. However, if we choose 2, the sequences are [a aab] [aa bb], which are not the solution. So we can only choose 1 as the second choice, but len("a") < len("aa"), which means we can never find a solution.
3. yes, a feasible solution is [1 3 1 1 3 2 2]
4. no, because we can only choose 2 as the first choice, if we choose one, the sequences are [b] and [bab]. We can only choose 3 as the second choice, the sequences are [b a] and [bab b]. Then we can only choose 2 as the third one also the forth one, [b a b b] and [bab b bab bab]. We can see if we only choose 2 and 3, the length of first sequence will always smaller than the second, so the fifth one we will choose 1, [b a b b bab a bab] and [bab b bab bab a b a], so we want "a" and "b" alternating appear so we can choose 2 to let the length of the second sequence can meet the first one, but we can find that the action to make "a" and "b" alternating appear always make a situation that sequence 1 is three bytes longer than sequence 2, which means we can never find a solution.
5. no, we can only choose 1 as the first one, [bba] and [b]. we can choose 1 as the second one, [bba bba] and [b b].we can choose 3 as the third one, [bba bba b] and [b b ab]. We can see when we meet the "ba" need to be satisfied, we can only choose 1 and then choose 3 for the second sequence, and the sequences will never appear "bbb" so we will never choose 2 which means the length of first sequence will always bigger than the second, so no solution.
